# Understanding ChatGPT at a high level

At a basic level, you feed ChatGPT an input (like a question or a prompt), producing an output based on what it's learned during its training. It doesn't know anything about the world in the way humans do. It doesn't understand concepts or have beliefs or opinions. It's essentially playing a very advanced game of predicting what text should come next based on the patterns it has seen in the vast amount of text data it was trained on.

It's also important to understand that ChatGPT doesn't have access to personal data about individuals unless it has been shared in the conversation with it. It's designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality.

That's a quick overview of ChatGPT. As we move through this course, we'll dive deeper into what it can do, how it can be used in our organization, and how to interact effectively. Stick around. There's plenty more to come!

And remember, there's no such thing as a silly question. If you're ever unsure or want to learn more, ask. We're all here to learn together.
