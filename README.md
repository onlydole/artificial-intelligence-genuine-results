# What is ChatGPT?

Hey there! Welcome to the first section of our course. This is where we introduce you to our star player, the AI language model called ChatGPT. Don't worry if you've never heard of it or are still trying to figure out what AI is all about. We've all been there. So, let's get started!

ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI. When we say "language model," we're talking about an AI trained to understand and generate human-like text. It's like having an intelligent text-based chat buddy who's excellent at answering questions, drafting emails, writing code, and even creating poetry.

The "GPT" in ChatGPT stands for "Generative Pretrained Transformer," which is a fancy way of saying it's a machine learning model that has been pre-trained on a massive amount of text data and can generate meaningful and coherent text based on the input it gets.
