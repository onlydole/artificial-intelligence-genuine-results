# Demonstrating examples of how ChatGPT can enhance workflows

To bring these use cases to life, let's walk through a few examples:

1. **Creating Documentation:** You're working on a new product feature and must update the documentation. You could ask ChatGPT to generate a first draft based on your notes, which you can refine and finalize.
2. **Code Review:** Suppose you're stuck on a tricky piece of code. You could present the problem to ChatGPT and ask it for suggestions or alternative approaches.
3. **Drafting Emails:** Have an important email to send but unsure where to start? Give ChatGPT the key points, and it can generate a draft for you to work from.
