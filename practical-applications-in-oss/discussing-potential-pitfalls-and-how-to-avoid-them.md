# Discussing potential pitfalls and how to avoid them

While ChatGPT can be a great asset, it's essential to be aware of potential pitfalls:

1. **Reliance on Outdated Information:** ChatGPT's knowledge is based on the information available until its last training cut-off. For the latest info, especially in fast-changing fields like ours, always cross-check with up-to-date resources.
2. **Misunderstandings:** ChatGPT might not always fully grasp the context or nuance of a prompt, which can lead to incorrect or nonsensical responses. If something seems off, double-check!
3. **Sensitive Information:** Never use ChatGPT to handle sensitive information. It's not designed to handle confidential data and should never be used for such tasks.

By understanding these potential issues, we can use ChatGPT effectively and responsibly.

And there you have it! That's how we can make ChatGPT work for us in the CNCF. In the next section, we'll dive into the technical side of things, so stay tuned!
