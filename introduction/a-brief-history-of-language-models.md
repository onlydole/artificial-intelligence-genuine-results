# A brief history of language models

Language models have come a long way. Early models could only handle simple tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence. But as the technology advanced, so did the complexity and sophistication of these models.

ChatGPT's journey began with its predecessor, GPT-1, a significant step forward in AI language models. But it was GPT-2, released in 2019, that made waves. It demonstrated an unprecedented ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences, making it a valuable tool for various tasks.

The current version, GPT-3, builds on this further with even more training data and greater capacity. It can understand context over a long conversation and generate remarkably human-like text in fluency and diversity.
