# The Importance of Providing Clear and Detailed Instructions

One of the keys to getting the most out of ChatGPT is learning how to communicate with it effectively. The more specific and clear your instructions, the better your results. If you're not getting what you need, try rephrasing or adding more detail to your prompt.

That wraps up our exploration of ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations. Next, we'll look at how to apply this knowledge in our open source ecosystem. Keep those thinking caps on, and see you in the next section!
