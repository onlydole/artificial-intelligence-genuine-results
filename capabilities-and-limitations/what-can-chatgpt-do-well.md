# What can ChatGPT do well?

Now that we know what ChatGPT is and how it works, it's time to dig a bit deeper. In this section, we will talk about what ChatGPT can do, where it stumbles, and why the way you talk to it matters. Strap in. Let's get to it!

ChatGPT is a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to handling text. It can do a lot of cool stuff:

1. **Answering Questions:** ChatGPT is like having a knowledgeable friend at your fingertips. Ask it about historical events, scientific concepts, tech stuff, and more. It uses the information it learned during training to provide informative answers.
2. **Generating Text:** Need to write an email, draft a report, or even create a poem? Give ChatGPT a prompt, which can generate various text outputs for you.
3. **Coding Help:** Yep, you read that right. ChatGPT can even help with code-related questions. It can provide code snippets, help debug errors, and explain programming concepts.
4. **Learning and Training:** ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for learning new topics and training. It's like having an interactive textbook that can explain differently until you get it.

But remember, as awesome as these capabilities sound, ChatGPT isn't perfect. This brings us to our next point...
