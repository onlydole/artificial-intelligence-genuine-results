# How to customize and control outputs

Understanding parameters can help you customize ChatGPT's outputs:

1. **For more focused and deterministic outputs:** Lower the temperature and top P values.
2. **For more creative and diverse outputs:** Increase the temperature and top P values.
3. **To control response length:** Adjust the max tokens value. Remember that terse responses might not always make sense, as they could be cut off mid-sentence.

And that's a wrap on our technical deep dive! With this understanding of how ChatGPT works under the hood and how to adjust its parameters for different needs, you're well-equipped to get the most out of this tool. In the next section, we'll discuss the ethics and responsible use of AI like ChatGPT. See you there!
